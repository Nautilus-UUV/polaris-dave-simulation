# polaris-dave-simulation

This repository contains simulation assets and configurations for the Polaris Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) within the DAVE Aquatic Virtual Environment (DAVE) simulation framework.

**Purpose:**

This project aims to provide a realistic and configurable simulation environment for testing, developing, and validating algorithms and control strategies for the Polaris UUV. It leverages the capabilities of DAVE for physics-based simulation, sensor modeling, and integration with ROS 2.

**Installation:**

To use this simulation, you need to have DAVE installed and configured on your system. Please follow the official DAVE installation tutorial:
